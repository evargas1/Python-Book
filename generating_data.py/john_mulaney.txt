I'll have the lobster special 

Who am I
And why am I comended to boil alive 
When all that I have down is live my life

And why would someone on a whim
choose from all to order him
Whos this guy

I thought that there was a unspoken rule 
That lobster in a diner is never cool 
A diner menu is way too long 
and half the things are fake or wrong 

must he die
how can you ever face his lobster friends
how can you ever face yourself again

Ive lied here 40 years I know an age that lobsters never grow
And in that time theres been no one to order any cardishan
Who am I

Lobster number one 

lame is
